## Abstract

COVID-19, with its mutated contagious strains, has hit again in 2021 - with a rapid resurgence in global cases, notably in India and countries in Europe and Latin America. At this juncture, rapid vaccination  lends  a  ray  of  hope.  April  2021  saw  a  doubling  of  global  vaccination  rates  and  a concomitant lowering of average transmission rates in countries with high vaccination rates. With vaccines doubly effective in battling the spread and shielding the economy, global cooperation is critical to ensuring availability of vaccines in all countries and addressing inter-country disparities in vaccination rates at the earliest.

The second wave in India has seen new peaks in daily cases, daily deaths, active cases and positivity rates. The policy response, as has been the global experience, includes localized micro-containment measures, state-specific movement restrictions, mobilization of health supplies and ramping up of health infrastructure. Recognizing vaccination as the crucial pillar to the 'Test, Track, Treat and Covid-appropriate behaviour' strategy, the access to vaccines has been deregulated and opened to all individuals above the age of 18 years.

The global economy recovered further in March and April, powered with vaccination drives and fiscal stimuli by few large economies. In April, due to the second wave in India, the momentum in economic recovery since the first wave has moderated. Agriculture continues to be the silver lining with record foodgrain production estimated in the ensuing crop year on the back of predicted normal monsoons. Rural demand indicators like tractor sales recorded a growth of 172 per cent and 36 per cent  compared  to  a  low  base  in  March  2020  and  even  the  pre-COVID  month  of  March  2019 respectively.

Industrial production showed mixed trends. While Index of Industrial Production (IIP) in February 2021 registered a broad-based decline of 3.6 per cent (YoY) and 3.9 per cent compared to January 2021, the eight-core index posted a growth of of 6.8 per cent (YoY) in March 2021 and 11.1 per cent compared to February 2021. In FY 2020-21, the core sector contracted by 7 per cent compared to 0.4  per  cent  growth  in  FY  2019-20  with  fertilizer  being  the  sole  growing  sector  and  electricity recovering steadily in the second half. The Purchasing Managers Index for manufacturing rose further to 55.5 in April with  consumer goods as the strongest-performing category, followed by capital goods and then intermediate goods. The rebound was also reflected in RBI's survey estimates on capacity utilization and manufacturers' optimism for the current year.

India's power consumption registered a growth rate of 40 per cent in April 2021 over April 2020 and 6.5 per cent over April 2019, signalling sustained industrial and commercial activity. In terms of value, e-way bills generated reached ₹17.36 lakh crore in April 2021 compared to ₹3.9 lakh crore in April 2020 and ₹14.8 lakh crore in April 2019 - the growth since April 2019 is an indicator of the increased formalisation of the economy. Power consumption and e-way bills have shown some sequential  moderation  in  second  half  of  April  resulting  from  localized  movement  restrictions. Railway freight continued to register double-digit growth in April compared to the low base last year and more than 10 per cent growth compared to April 2019. Port traffic also continued to grow in  March  for  the  fifth  consecutive  month,  mirroring  the  boost  in  global  economic  recovery. Automobile  sales, buttressed with pent-up demand  and  preference for personal vehicles, demonstrated a strong YoY recovery of 115 per cent in passenger vehicles and 71 per cent in two and three wheelers in March 2021 over the low base of March 2020 due to the onset of the pandemic.

Latest data on corporate earnings signals a manufacturing turnaround in Q4: FY 2020-21, with 12.5 per cent growth in net sales and 9.5 per cent rise in income for a sample of 213 companies. Digital payments continued to gain momentum in April with UPI transactions volume and amount more than doubling previous year levels. CPI-Combined inflation rose to 5.52 per cent, mainly on account of high food inflation. WPI inflation increased to an 8-year high of 7.39 per cent, led by oil and metal prices as well as base-effect, exceeding its CPI counterpart after nearly 2 years. Softening food  and  fuel  prices,  with  normal  monsoon  and  expected  supply  easing  of  food  products,  may provide succour to a potent risk of rise in input prices surfacing as retail inflation.

On the external front, India's trade deficit hit its lowest in FY 2020-21 since FY 2007-08, with a stronger contraction in imports compared to that of exports. While drugs and pharma were the frontrunners in exports, safe-haven gold led the imports trajectory. In April 2021, economic recovery manifested in the rising import growth of 166 per cent and 7 per cent over 2020 and 2019 levels respectively. Exports, too, grew by 197 per cent over 2020 levels and 16 per cent over 2019 - the significant growth compared to 2019 provides a tentative indicator of the positive impact of the policy focus through, inter alia, the Production Linked Incentive Scheme. Overall, India registered a trade deficit of US$15.24 billion in April 2021.

While overall financial conditions remained accommodative, credit growth continued to be muted at 5.3 per cent as on April 9, 2021. Sectorally, agriculture, medium industry and trade services led the credit offtake in March, while credit to small and large industry and NBFC services remained subdued. Easy financing conditions enabled the corporate sector to raise substantial funds from financial markets.

Second wave of the pandemic hit the market sentiment as Nifty 50 and the S&amp;P BSE Sensex recorded losses of 0.4 per cent and 1.5 per cent respectively in April, and Rupee depreciated by 2.3 per cent to reach 74.51 INR/USD in April. This was mirrored by net FPI outflows of US$ 1.18 billion in April.  Domestic  financial  conditions,  nevertheless,  continue  to  remain  comfortable  with  RBI's support to liquidity, with open market operations worth ₹ 3.17 lakh crore carried out in FY 202021. Launch of G-SAP 1.0 towards stable and orderly management of the yield curve, is a significant tool for forward guidance.

The fiscal position of the Central Government has witnessed improvement in the recent months with a revival in the economic activities during the second half of FY: 2020-21. As per provisional figures, net direct tax collections for FY 2020-21 are 4.5 per cent higher than Revised Estimates (RE) and 5 percent  higher  than  collections  in  FY  2019-20  -  the  significant  growth  compared  to  2019-20 provides an indication of economic recovery since the first wave.  Net indirect tax collections for FY 2020-21 were 8.2 percent higher than the RE and 12.3 per cent over collections in FY 2019-20. Central GST collections during FY 2020-21 are 106 per cent of RE though 8 per cent lower than the last year's collection. In the second half of FY 2020-21, GST collections registered a good growth and collections exceeded ₹1 lakh crore in each of the last six months owing to economic recovery. GST collections registered another record high of ₹1.41 lakh crore in April, indicative of continual economic recovery.

The second wave of COVID-19 has posed a downside risk to economic activity in the first quarter of FY 2021-22. However, there are reasons to expect a muted economic impact as compared to the first wave. Learning to 'operate with COVID-19', as borne by international experience, provides a silver lining of economic resilience amidst the second wave.

## COVID-19: Rapid Resurgence of infections

- 1. Globally, COVID-19 cases are on the rise again, notably in India and some countries in Europe and Latin America, with the spread of more infectious variants. April recorded the highest average daily cases of 7.5 lakh witnessing a 58 percent hike compared to previous month. Global mobility, therefore, declined in April, as many countries tightened movement restrictions. At the same  time,  global  vaccination  rates  have  almost  tripled  from  an  average  0.7  vaccinations  per thousand population per day in February 2021 to 2.3 vaccinations per thousand population per day in April 2021.The pace is, however, markedly uneven across countries. Recent trends of new cases globally show that vaccination drive has been successful in reducing transmission rates as new cases are rising at a much slower pace on average in countries with high vaccination rates.

Note:  'Countries  with  high  vaccination  rate'  refers  to  countries  where  more  than  20  percent  of  the population had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine by 30 th  April 2021.

## India battles the ferocious second wave

2. Several parts of  India  have  been  severely  hit  by  the  swift  spread  of  the  second  wave  of COVID-19 with cases continuing to reach daily new highs. The total number of active cases have surged past the 35-lakh mark, accounting for 17 percent of the total infections, while recovery is around 82 percent. During the second wave, active cases have increased at a faster pace with 5 lakh cases added in just 4 days - compared to 50 days during the peak of the first wave.

- 3. The share of new cases is concentrated in 11 states representing ~80 percent of the total new cases in April. Maharashtra continues to be the major contributor to the virus spread followed by Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Delhi and Kerala. During April, the share of top 15 districts declined both for new cases and deaths, suggesting that the new variant is highly contagious and has begun to spread to other parts of the country.
- 4. The second wave has seen daily new deaths being almost 3 times higher than the first wave. However,  cumulative  case  fatality  rate  has  been  restrained  and  currently  stands  at  1.1  percent. District level data depicts that incremental deaths are more concentrated when compared to the first wave.
- 5. A rise in weekly new cases can be witnessed across all States and UTs. New cases on an average rose seven-fold in the last week of April compared to the first week of April, while positivity rate on an average has increased in the last week by four times as compared to first week of April. States like Goa, Delhi and West Bengal recorded positivity rate of more than 30 percent. On the other hand, positivity rate has shown a declining trend in Maharashtra during last week of April and might be drawing near its peak.

- 6. Keeping the focus on 'Test, Track, Treat, Vaccinate and COVID-appropriate Behaviour' strategy, India's testing also touched new peaks with more than 19 lakh daily tests conducted in last few days. India positivity rate rose sharply from 6.4 per cent in March 2021 to 20.7 per cent in April 2021, amid the highly contagious new variants of the virus. Given the high positivity rates, most of the States need to expand testing as is evident from the figure below.

## Vaccination: Key to curb pandemic spread and to sustained economic recovery

- 7. India's vaccination phase-I prioritized the protection of Health Care Workers (HCWs) and Front-Line Workers (FLWs). As systems and processes stabilized, phase-II focused on protecting the vulnerable i.e., all people above 45 years of age, accounting for more than 80 per cent of the COVID-19 mortality in the country. During the second wave, however, around 50 per cent of the cases reported belong to younger population less than 45 years of age. To curb the rapid rise in daily cases, phase-III vaccination drive has begun from 1 May 2021 to vaccinate people belonging to the age group of 18-45 years. Vaccination access and pricing has also been deregulated to quicken the pace of vaccination across states and across all age groups.
- 8. Vaccination is gaining pace, with cumulative administered doses surpassing 16 crore. Of these, 3.6 crore doses have been administered to healthcare and frontline workers - the warriors combating the pandemic. While 6.6 crore doses have been administered to senior citizens, 5.9 crore doses have been administered to citizens aged 45 to 60 years. 9,02,731 beneficiaries of the age group 18-44 years have received their first dose of COVID vaccine across 12 States/UTs. Initial vaccine hesitancy seems to have receded with average daily doses more than 29 lakh in the month of April 2021 as compared to 15.7 lakh in March 2021. State-wise Vaccine Hesitancy Index calculated as doses  administered  per  100  doses  available  show  that  North  Eastern  states  and  states  like  Goa, Jharkhand, Delhi, Bihar, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh are experiencing vaccine hesitancy.

- 10. Growing  infections  and  consequent  restrictions,  though  local/  regional  in  nature,  have imparted a downside risk to economic activity. The impact of restrictions is evident in a decline in the google mobility indicator to -37 percent in April 2021 from around -22 percent in the preceding month. The Oxford Stringency Index in India has surged to around 71 in April 2021 from 59 in the preceding month, though it is still below 100 in April 2020 and average of 85 in Q1: FY 2020-21.
- 11. The global policy response towards second waves and beyond have mostly taken the form of localized movement restrictions, curfews, and restrictions on public gatherings. Global experience also  suggests  that  economic  impacts  from  subsequent  waves  are  smaller  than  from  the  first  as economies learn to 'operate with COVID'. The increased coverage of population under vaccination has been effective both in controlling the spread of covid and boosting mobility. The need of the hour is, therefore, to expand vaccination at a fast pace.

## Global Economy: Renewed Optimism amid heightened need for global cooperation

- 12. Global growth projections have been revised upwards by IMF, with upward revisions in second half of 2020 for most countries as movement restrictions were eased and economies adjusted to new ways of working. Improved outlook for 2021 and 2022 was borne out of vaccine-facilitated recovery and additional fiscal support by few large economies.
- 13. Global PMI continued its broad-based rise in March, with manufacturing PMI registering a 10-year high and services PMI reviving to 33-months high. With major fiscal support measures announced in US, activity levels continued their upturn into April, firmed by reopening of service sector, as more than half of the population got vaccinated. UK PMI saw the fastest private sector growth  since  2013,  with  loosening  of  movement  restrictions.  The  PMI  expansion  in  Eurozone continued for second month in April, driven mainly by manufacturing.  Japanese PMI ventured into expansionary zone in April for the first time since January 2020, led by manufacturing activity and exports, while services sector continued to contract.

## Commodity and Inflation

14. Overall commodity prices continued their rise in March, led by demand revival and optimism regarding US infrastructure package, and supply disruptions in metals including copper and nickel. A broad-based rise in commodity prices poses inflation risks especially in presence of decidedly accommodative monetary conditions. Crude oil prices, on the other hand, softened in March after firming up in February considering renewed COVID-19 surges, intermittent vaccinations in Europe, and easing of supply cuts. Gold prices, too, have been declining on the back of dollar depreciation and lower US long term bond yields. Powered by strong recovery, rise in gasoline prices and base effect, consumer price inflation in US firmed up to 2.6 per cent. Euro area inflation rose to 1.3 per cent, with significant variation across member countries driven mainly by services and energy prices. CPI inflation in China rose slightly on the back of renewed demand, energy prices and base effect. A 4.4 per cent rise in China's producer prices, strong recovery in US and supply disruptions posed further input price risks to the global economy. Prices in Japan underwent a modest fall of 0.1 per cent in March.

## Global Trade

15. World trade recovered further in April, with uptick in manufacturing activity followed by a nascent recovery in services trade. On the downside, freight rates have been hiked by the surging demand for containerized exports from Asia. The backlog of supply stuck up due to Suez Canal blockage in March is likely to have spilled over to April trade, tightening an already stretched supply for semiconductors industry. Global commercial flight activity and port activity further rose in April. While air transport remains more than 25 per cent below pre-pandemic levels, the average daily number of international commercial flights in April rose by 6 per cent Month on Month (MoM) and 161 per cent Year on Year (YoY) (given the base effects).

## Financial markets

16. Global financial conditions remained favourable as US recovery, increasing vaccinations, and lower bond yields fared well for stock market buoyancy. While US equity market scaled a new peak in mid-April and equities of advanced economies remained bullish, COVID-19 resurge-related anxieties surfaced in the second fortnight. UK's FTSE 100 underwent a similar trend, closing at 3.8 per cent higher at end of April compared to March-end. Capital outflows from emerging market economies eased with softening of bond yields. However, country-specific factors such as COVID19 resurgence in India and consequent bearish sentiment underpinned a modest rise in overall equity indices. Resurging cases also cast a shadow on Japan's Nikkei 225, which fell modestly by 1.3 per cent in April-end compared to March-end. China's Shanghai Composite Index rose modestly as corporate earnings increased on the back of strong raw material demand. In the currency markets, US dollar index weakened by 2.1 per cent MoM in April against a defined basket of currencies due to easing of bond yields. Euro, Yen, and Chinese Yuan appreciated slightly on the back of weakened dollar and economic recovery.

17. Global  economic  recovery  has  strengthened  further  in  April,  despite  renewed  surge  in COVID-19 cases and emergence of new and more infectious strains. Strong global demand for goods was  accompanied  by  rise  in  services  sector  activity.  Rise  in  vaccinations,  loosened  movement restrictions, and fiscal support by few large economies has infused optimism in global markets with upward  revisions  to  global  growth  forecasts.  However,  immediate  and  long-term  concerns  of disparity in vaccine access, slowing human capital formation, and rising debt levels call for active global cooperation.

Domestic  Macro-economic  overview:  Real  sector  continues  to  recover  though  the  impact  of second wave moderates the momentum of recovery

## Agricultural Sector

18. India is set to have the third consecutive normal monsoon this year with India Meteorological Department's (IMD's) prediction of a normal southwest monsoon in June-September at 98 per cent of the long period average (LPA). This follows the above-average monsoon rainfall of 110 per cent of LPA and 109 per cent of LPA, respectively, in 2019 and 2020. India had earlier experienced three consecutive years of normal rainfall in 1996, 1997 and 1998.  IMD has introduced a new dynamic Multi-Modal Ensemble (MME) forecasting system this year which will provide month-wise and state-wise  probability  rainfall  forecasts.  This  will  enable  a  better  idea  of  probable  spatial  and temporal  distribution  of  monsoon  rains.  This,  in  turn,  will  help  the  farmers  to  plan  sowing  and harvesting of their crops and enhance their productivity and production levels. This would also guide Government authorities to achieve a better state of disaster-preparedness against floods and famines across specific districts.

19. With the prediction of a 'normal' monsoon, the government has set a record target to raise foodgrain production by 1.3 percent to 307.31 million tonnes during 2021-22 crop year, starting July. Public procurement of rice and wheat during the year 2020-21 has been going smoothly. The government has set a target to buy 42.74 MT of wheat for the central pool during 2021, which is nearly  10  percent  more  than  actual  quantity  purchased  last  year.  FCI  currently  has  adequate availability of stocks of food grain with more than 77 million tonnes of food grain, 3.6 times the mandatory stock requirement for April.

20. In view of the resurgence of the second wave of COVID-19, it has been decided to allocate an additional free-of-cost food grains @ 5 kg per person per month to nearly 80 Crore beneficiaries covered under National Food Security Act, 2013 over and above their regular monthly entitlements for May and June 2021 under the 'Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PM-GKAY)'. During 2020-21, Government of India had announced PMGKAY-I (April-June 2020) and PMGKAY-II (July-November 2020) under which 104 LMT wheat and 201 LMT rice were supplied by FCI to the respective State/ UT governments. MGNREGS was a critical support in providing rural employment during the last year with continued high demand of work by 3.7 crore persons (86.5 percent increase) and generation of 21.2 crore persondays of employment (50 per cent increase) in April 2021.

## MGNREGA: Bedrock of support for Rural India in times of crisis

Launched  in  2005  under  the  National  Rural  Employment  Guarantee  Act  (NREGA),  India's National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS), implemented by Ministry of Rural Development, is one of the largest demand driven public employment scheme in the world. It was notified in 200 districts initially starting February 2006, extended to an additional 130 districts in 2007-2008 and remaining from April 2008. Today, it covers the entire country except for districts that  have  a  hundred  percent  urban  population.  NREGA was rechristened as Mahatma Gandhi National  Rural  Employment  Guarantee  Act  (MGNREGA)  on  2  October  2009  on  the  50 th Anniversary of Panchayati Raj system in India with 2009-2010 observed as the year of Gram Sabha. It provides at least one hundred days of guaranteed wage employment in every financial year to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work. There are two important legislative provisions under MGNREGA- (i) work should be provided within 15 days of demanding for work failing which the workers are entitled to an unemployment allowance and (ii)  workers should be paid within 15 days of completion of work failing which they are entitled to a delay compensation.

MGNREGA assumed renewed significance as a lifeline for rural distress caused by the COVID19 pandemic. The Scheme received an all-time high budget allocation of Rs. 61,500 crore under MGNREGA for FY 2020-21 with an additional provision of Rs. 40,000 crore made under the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan. This was a 55.5 percent increase over the actual expenditure on the Scheme in 2019-20. The Scheme emerged as a critical social protection buffer in the first half of

2020-21. It provided employment of a record 389 crore persondays to 7.6 crore households and 11.2 crore persons in 2020-21. The months of June and July 2020 witnessed an unprecedented surge in both work demanded and supplied under MGNREGA.

MGNREGA became the main livelihood source for millions of migrants and other workers in rural India providing much needed daily wages and subsistence. With Government having notified increase  in  daily  wages  at  a  difficult  time  across  all  States/UTs,  the  average  wage  paid  to  a MGNREGA worker stood at Rs. 204 in March 2021 as compared to Rs. 184 in March 2020.

A major thrust of MGNREGA in the last five years has been creation of durable community and individual beneficiary assets.  In  FY  2020-21,  a  total  of  82.7  lakh  works  got  completed  under MGNREGA, an increase of 10.8 per cent over the previous year. Maximum YoY growth in asset creation was seen in rural infrastructure (28.6 per cent) and Natural Resource Management Works (NRM) (20.9 per cent) such as check dam, ponds, renovation of traditional water bodies, land development, embankment, field bunds, field channels, plantations, contour trenches. Individual assets for households of vulnerable sections, which inter-alia include development of fallow/waste

lands, house construction and promotion of livestock and fisheries, also witnessed a 4.5 per cent growth in  completed works in  the  FY  2020-21.  Bihar  saw  the  highest  YoY  growth  in  works completion in the pandemic year.

To address the issues of returnee migrant workers and similarly affected rural population through a multipronged strategy of providing immediate employment &amp; livelihood opportunities to the distressed,  a  massive  employment-cum-rural  public  works  Campaign  named  'Garib  Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan' (GKRA) was launched on on June 20, 2020 in 116 selected districts across 6 States of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Odisha with a resource envelope of Rs 50,000  crore.  MGNREGA helped absorb this sudden surge of work demand, especially in these 116 districts as is evident from figures below.

Industry

- 21. After registering a growth of 1.6 per cent in December 2020, industrial production moved into the negative territory by contracting 0.9 per cent in January 2021 (against growth of 2.2 per cent in January 2020) and 3.6 per cent in February 2021 (against growth of 5.5 per cent in February 2020).  The  sequential  deterioration  in  February  2021  relative  to  January  2021  was  broad-based across sectors with YoY contraction in manufacturing and mining at 3.7 per cent and 5.5 per cent respectively.  The  use-based  categories  displayed  a  mixed  trend  with  the  main  input  sectors  viz; primary  goods,  capital  goods,  intermediate  goods  and  infrastructure/construction  goods  sector recording negative growth in February 2021. IIP is based on production estimates of 407 items (5digit NIC classification), out of which during February 2021, only 195 items have recorded a growth - lower that 218 items and 208 items December 2020 and January 2021, respectively.
- 22. The Eight Core sector output rose to a 32-month high of 6.8 per cent in March 2021 chiefly on account of a negative base of - 8.5 per cent in March 2020 due to the onset of the pandemic. For FY 2020-21, the core sector contracted by 7 per cent compared with a subdued pace of 0.4 per cent in FY 2019-20. During the year, there has been a broad-based decline across almost all the sectors with the impact being sharp in refinery products, steel and cement sector. Fertiliser has been the only sector which saw growth on the back of robust demand from the agricultural sector. The impact on electricity production has been relatively lower as resumption of economic activities in the second half of the fiscal supported its growth.

- 23. India's PMI Manufacturing Index of 55.5 in April, a slight improvement over 55.4 in March, indicated that prospects for India's manufacturing sector remained favourable as companies scaled up production in line with a further improvement in demand. Consumer goods was the strongestperforming category, followed by capital goods and then intermediate goods. New export orders increased for the eighth consecutive month in April and at the fastest rate since October 2020 with a pick-up in international demand for Indian goods.
- 24. As per the RBI OBICUS Survey, the aggregate level of capacity utilisation improved to 66.6 per cent in Q3:2020-21 from 63.3 per cent recorded in Q2:2020-21, on the back of strengthening of production activities and easing of the restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As per RBI's Industrial Outlook Survey, manufacturing companies assessed further strengthening of production, order  books  and  employment  during  Q4:2020-21.  For  the  first  three  quarters  of  FY  2021-22, manufacturers  are  optimistic  on  improvement  in  production,  capacity  utilization,  employment conditions and the overall business situation.
- 25. India's power consumption registered a growth rate of 40 per cent in April 2021 over April 2020 and 6.5 per cent over April 2019, signalling sustained industrial and commercial activity. While the low base of April 2020 also contributed to the high growth number for April 2021, the growth of 6.5 per cent over April 2019 is indicative of the economic recovery in manufacturing. While power consumption has been recovering since September 2020 to reach record levels during the first week of April 2021, the second half of April 2021 showed some signs of moderation. There are variations across States- some like Maharashtra, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh have shown moderation in April 2021 as compared to March 2021 while some like Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have shown an increase over the same period.
- 26. E-way  bills  generated  is  a  strong  leading  indicator  of  revenue  collections,  supply  chain corrections and logistics growth. Sustained recovery in interstate movement of goods since May 2020, both in terms of YoY and sequential movement, augurs well for regaining economic normalcy. Total e-way bills generated including both inter-state and intra-state movement stood at 5.8 crore compared to 0.9 crore in April 2020 and 5.3 crore in April 2019. In terms of value, e-way bills generated reached ₹ 17.36 lakh crore in April 2021 compared to ₹ 3.9 lakh crore in April 2020 and ₹ 14.8 lakh crore in April 2019. However, the 7 day moving average of daily e-way bills generated in April 2021 indicates that the localised restrictions in the wake of second wave of COVID-19 may have affected the sequential momentum in e-way bills.

- 27. Gross GST revenue collection for April 2021 recorded a new high of ₹ 1,41,384 crore of which CGST is ₹ 27,837 crore, SGST is ₹ 35,621 crore, IGST is ₹ 68,481 crore (including ₹ 29,599 crore collected on import of goods) and Cess is ₹ 9,445 crore (including ₹ 981 crore collected on import of goods). Despite the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic affecting several parts of the country, Indian businesses have once again shown remarkable resilience by not only complying with the return filing requirements but also paying their GST dues in a timely manner during the month. Steady increase in GST revenues crossing ₹ 1 lakh crore for the last seven months in succession is a clear indication of sustained economic recovery during this period.
- 28. Highway traffic movement as captured in average daily electronic toll collection (ETC) both in terms of value and volume also indicated sustained recovery, surpassing pre COVID-19 levels (average of Jan and Feb, 2020) since September 2020. Some moderation in sequential movement was observed in April 2021, owing to localised movement restrictions imposed to contain second wave of the pandemic.
- 29. Strong pent-up demand renewal continued in the last month of FY 2020-21 with domestic sales of passenger vehicle and two &amp; three wheelers growing at a strong 115 per cent and 71 per cent YoY respectively during March 2021 over the low base of March 2020. This suggests shifting consumer  preference  for  personal  travel  in  response  to  the  pandemic.  Total  domestic  sales  of commercial vehicles in FY 2020-21 were 5.68 lakh units, 20.7 per cent lower than previous year levels. Resilient rural demand trajectory since June 2020 continued with tractor sales growing at a strong 172.4 per cent YoY and 12.5 per cent sequentially in March 2021. Even on a pre-COVID base of March 2019, tractor sales grew at 36.5 per cent.

- 30. Boost in  industrial  activity  can  also  be  witnessed  with  uptick  in  port  traffic  and  railway freight. Port traffic registered a positive growth of 16.4 per cent in March for the fifth consecutive month indicating a sustained expansion of global economic activities. Railway freight continued to expand and achieved a double-digit growth during March with the growth momentum continuing strongly in April. Railways recorded more than 10 per cent increase in freight loading in April as compared to normal year of 2019-20, breaking previous loading records for the 8th consecutive month  despite  COVID-19  related  challenges.  Improvements  in  freight  movements  will  be institutionalized and incorporated in the upcoming zero-based timetable.
- 31. Air cargo growth also witnessed modest improvement with lowering of contraction from 11.0 per cent in January 2021 to 8.5 per cent in February 2021. Air passenger traffic for domestic airlines in February as per AAI data was 168.7 lakh as compared to 167.3 lakh in January 2021.
- 32. PMI Services fell from 54.6 in March to 54.0 in April. The Indian service sector, nevertheless, remained resilient to the resurgence of the COVID-19 crisis with output growth remaining strong despite easing to a three-month low. Rate of expansion in new business remained unchanged from March while input costs witnessed sharpest increase since December 2011.
- 33. Corporate earnings results of 213 companies for Q4:2020-21 (available as on May 2 2021),

<!-- image -->

representing  more  than  15  per  cent  of  total  sales  of  corporate  sector,  signal  brightened  revival prospects for the manufacturing sector. These 213 companies witnessed a 9.5 per cent YoY growth in income and 12.8 per cent growth in net sales in the last quarter of FY 2020-21. With expenses growing  by  a  modest  5.4  per  cent,  profits  after  tax  saw  strong  growth  of  38.4  per  cent.  The manufacturing sector continued to display signs of turnaround with growth in total income, net sales and operating profit of 87 companies in the sample at a healthy 18.7 per cent, 22.1 per cent and 48.1 per cent respectively in Q4:2020-21. On the services side, however, the recovery remains gradual with total income, net sales and operating profits of 61 non-financial services companies growing at 10.3 per cent, 12.4 per cent and 31.4 per cent respectively. From an employment perspective, growth in  salaries  and  wages  was  a  positive  5  per  cent  plus  for  both  manufacturing  and  non-financial services companies in the last quarter of FY 2020-21.

34. The digital payment infrastructure put in place during the past few years and the sustained efforts and facilitation by GOI, RBI and other agencies since 2016 have led to huge acceptance and usage of digital modes of payments for retail transactions including those for small value transactions. This momentum has been further spurred by the pandemic. During FY 2020-21, the value of UPI digital transactions was almost double at Rs 41.0 lakh crore as compared to Rs 21.3 lakh crore in FY 2019-20. UPI transactions, in terms of value, stood at Rs 4.93 lakh crore in April 2021, more than 3 times compared to the same month in the previous year. UPI transaction volume increased to 264 crore  in  April  2021,  more  than  double  the  volume  in  April  2020.  Sequentially,  however,  UPI payment volumes decreased by 3.4 per cent in April 2021 over the previous month and transaction value declined by 2.2 per cent compared to March 2021.

35. Indian basket of crude oil prices stood at 63.1 USD/bbl in April 2021 compared to an average of 64.8 USD/bbl in March 2021 and 61.4 USD/bbl in February 2021 driven by demand build up on optimism from vaccination and continuing production cuts by OPEC plus. Domestic prices of petrol and diesel remained relatively stable in April 2021. Domestic consumption of petroleum products in FY 20-21 recorded a contraction of 9.1 per cent compared to FY 2019-20, reflecting the impact of the pandemic on demand compression and fuel consumption in various sectors. Though it recorded a positive growth in March 2021 compared to both previous month and corresponding month of previous  year,  preliminary  data  from  fuel  retailers  shows  that  there  has  been  a  fall  in  fuel consumption in April 2021 due to certain movement restrictions.

## Inflation witnessing upside pressures

36. The average CPI inflation in FY 2020-21 recorded an uptick to 6.2 per cent from 4.8 per cent in FY 2019-20, overshooting the Monetary Policy Committee's (MPC's) medium-term target band of 2-6 per cent, after a gap of six years. Overall CPI-C inflation in March 2021 has increased to 5.52 per cent from 5.03 per cent in February 2021, mainly on account of increase in food inflation. Food inflation, based on Consumer Food Price Index (CFPI), increased to 4.94 per cent in March 2021 as compared to 3.87 per cent in February 2021 mainly on account of relatively high inflation of 'oils &amp; fats', 'pulses and products', 'meat and fish' and 'fruits'. Following an uptick in commodity prices, rising  demand and firming up of pricing power, the core-CPI inflation (CPI excluding food and beverages, and fuel and light) hardened further to a 29-month high of 6.0 per cent in March 2021 from 5.9 per cent in in February 2021.

- 37. The average WPI inflation eased to 1.2 per cent in FY 2020-21 from 1.7 per cent in FY 201920. During the month of March 2021, WPI inflation increased to a 103 month high of 7.39 per cent as compared to 4.17 per cent in February 2021 on account of increase in inflation of all major groups, viz, Primary articles, Fuel &amp; power and Manufactured products. For Manufactured Products it has been continuously rising since June 2020 and recorded 7.34 per cent in March 2021. The non-food manufactured products (WPI Core) inflation increased to 7.01 per cent in March 2021 from 5.56 per cent in the previous month. After a gap of 22-months, the WPI inflation exceeded the CPI inflation by 190 basis points in March 2021.
- 38. Going forward, forecast of a normal south-west monsoon and the slight softening of the pressure  on  oil  prices  may  soften  food  and  fuel  inflationary  pressures  respectively.  However,  a combination of high international commodity prices and logistics costs may push up input price pressures across manufacturing and services. The outlook for core inflation is likely to be impacted by the disruptions in supply chains due to localised restrictions across States. RBI has, accordingly, revised its CPI projections to 5.2 per cent in Q1:2021-22; 5.2 per cent in Q2; 4.4 per cent in Q3; and 5.1 per cent in Q4, with risks broadly balanced.

## Merchandise Trade Looking up

39. In FY 2020-21, with exports at US$ 290.6 billion and imports at US$ 389.2 billion, India registered a lower merchandise trade deficit of US$ 98.6 billion, as against the deficit of US$ 161.3 billion in FY 2019-20 - lowest trade deficit experienced since 2007-08. Exports registered a negative growth of (-) 7.3 per cent with a sharper contraction in imports at (-) 18.0 per cent in 2020-21. Drugs and Pharmaceuticals have contributed maximum in the export growth in 2020-21, while petroleum products pulled the exports growth down. Gold has contributed the maximum in the import growth, while petroleum, crude and products have contributed to the contraction, largely attributable to fall in fuel prices. India's overall trade balance (Merchandise and Services combined) is estimated to be in deficit at US$ 12.7 billion in FY 2020-21 as compared to US$ 77.9 billion in FY 2019-20.

40. During April 2021, India's merchandise exports was valued at US$ 30.2 billion, an increase of 197.0 per cent over US$ 10.2 billion in April 2020 and an increase of 16.0 per cent over US$ 26.0 billion in April 2019. India's merchandise imports in April 2021 were US$ 45.5 billion, an increase of 166.0 per cent over US$ 17.1 billion in April 2020 and an increase of 7.2 per cent over US$ 42.4 billion in April 2019. India is thus a net importer in April with a trade deficit of US$ 15.24 billion,

as compared to US$ 6.92 billion in April 2020 and US$ 16.4 billion in April 2019. Major export commodities  which  have  recorded  growth  in  April  include  gems  and  jewellery,  jute,  carpet, handicrafts, leather, electronic goods, oil meals, cashew, engineering, petroleum products, marine products and chemicals.

## Financial Sector

## Accommodative financial conditions, muted credit growth

- 41. Overall  monetary  and  credit  conditions  in  the  economy  remained  accommodative  with money supply (M3) growing by 11.3 per cent as on April 9, 2021 compared to 10.2 per cent a year ago. As on April 23, 2021, currency in circulation grew at 15.2 per cent compared to 15.7 per cent a year ago. While cash withdrawal from ATMs, Point of Sale devices and micro-ATMs has also been picking up since September 2020 both in volume and value terms, it remains below previous year levels.

42. Bank credit growth stood at 5.3 per cent in the fortnight ending April 9, 2021 as compared to 5.6 per cent in the previous fortnight. Non-food credit growth of scheduled commercial banks stood  at  5.4  per  cent  as  on  April  9,  2021  as  compared  to  5.5  per  cent  as  on  March  26,  2021. Continuing its uptrend, credit growth to agriculture and allied activities accelerated to 12.3 per cent in March 2021 from 4.2 per cent in March 2020. Credit growth to industry decelerated marginally to 0.4 per cent in March 2021 from 0.7 per cent in March 2020. However, credit to medium industries registered a robust growth of 28.8 per cent in March 2021 as compared to a contraction of 0.7 per cent a year ago. Credit growth to micro and small industries decelerated to 0.5 per cent in March 2021 from 1.7 per cent a year ago, while credit to large industries contracted by 0.8 per cent as compared to a growth of 0.6 per cent a year ago. Credit growth to the services sector decelerated to 1.4 per cent in March 2021 from 7.4 per cent in March 2020, mainly due to deceleration in credit growth to NBFCs and contraction in credit to professional services. However, credit to trade segment continued  to  perform  well,  registering  accelerated  growth  of  11.8  per  cent  in  March  2021  as compared  to  4.6  per  cent  a  year  ago.  Slowdown  in  growth  of  personal  loans  continued,  as  it decelerated to 10.2 per cent in March 2021 from 15.0 per cent a year ago. However, vehicle loans and loans against gold jewellery continued to perform well during the month, registering accelerated growth.

- 43. Easy  financing  conditions  enabled  the  corporate  sector  to  raise  substantial  funds  from financial markets. Private placements of listed corporate bonds stood at ₹7.72 lakh crore in FY 202021, 14.4 per cent higher than that in previous year (₹6.7 lakh crore), supported by low interest rate and surplus liquidity in the system.

43. FY 2020-21 was a bullish year for stock markets, supported by stimulus measures, surplus liquidity and record FPI flows. FY 2020-21 witnessed a record FPI inflow of USD 36.2 billion, the highest in a decade after 2014-15. Net FDI stood strong at USD 41.4 billion in FY 2020-21 (April to February, 2020), 6.1 per cent higher than the corresponding period of previous year. India's foreign exchange reserves stood at US$ 584.11 billion on April 23, 2021 covering imports of 18.5 months. However, the second wave of the pandemic has affected the overall market sentiment and consequent rupee movements. In April 2021, Nifty 50 and the S&amp;P BSE Sensex fell by 0.4 per cent and 1.5 per cent respectively. Rupee depreciated by 2.3 per cent in April 2021 (74.51 INR/USD) compared to March  2021  (72.79  INR/USD).  FPI  witnessed  an  outflow  of  US$  1.19  billion  compared  to  an outflow of US$ 1.9 billion in April 2019.

44. Domestic financial conditions continue to remain comfortable with RBI's consistent efforts to maintain adequate liquidity support. The Central bank has conducted open market purchases to the  tune  of  ₹3.13  lakh  crore  in  FY  2020-21  and  ₹25000  crore  in  April  2021.  Average  daily  net liquidity absorption under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) was at Rs. 5.8 lakh crore in April 2021. Further, RBI conducted two fine-tuning variable rate repo auctions of ₹25,000 crore each on March 26 and March 31, 2021 for 11 days and 5 days respectively to provide for unanticipated liquidity needs and ensure flexibility to the banking system. During April, the RBI conducted two 14-day variable rate reverse repo auctions on April 9 and April 23, 2021 for ₹2 lakh crore each. As a one-time measure, RBI did not conduct any variable rate reverse repo auction for the fortnight beginning March 27, 2021 to ensure ample liquidity to fulfil year-end CRR requirements.

45. In its monetary policy statement on April 7, 2021, RBI announced extension of TLTRO on Tap Scheme by six months till September 30, 2021 and additional support of ₹50,000 crore to the All-India Financial Institutions (AIFIs) for fresh lending in FY 21-22, thereby standing to ensure adequate liquidity to productive sectors of economy. Further on May 5, 2021, RBI announced further measures as a part of its calibrated and comprehensive strategy against the second wave. These measures included Term Liquidity Facility of ₹50,000 crore to Ease Access to Emergency Health Services, Special Long-Term Repo Operations (SLTRO) ₹10,000 crore for Small Finance Banks (SFBs), Lending by Small Finance Banks (SFBs) to MFIs for on-lending classified as Priority Sector Lending,  incentivising  credit  to  MSME  Entrepreneurs,  Resolution  Framework  2.0  for  COVID Related Stressed Assets of Individuals, Small Businesses and MSMEs, rationalization of compliance

46. Committed  to  ensuring  a  stable  and  orderly  management  of  the  yield  curve  amidst comfortable liquidity conditions, RBI introduced a secondary market G-sec acquisition programme or G-SAP 1.0. On April 15, 2021, RBI conducted the first tranche in which it bought the entire notified amount of Rs. 25,000 crore. India's benchmark 10-year G-Sec yield declined from 6.13 percent as on end-March 2021 to 6.04 per cent as on end-April 2021 on the back of RBI measures of  open  market  operations  (OMOs)  and  critical  forward  guidance.  Tracking  gilts,  10-year  AAA corporate bond yield spreads also declined from 76 bps in March to 27 bps in April 2021.

## Fiscal Situation

47. The fiscal position of the Central Government has witnessed improvement in the second half of  FY  2020-21  due  to  a  revival  in  economic  activities.  The  provisional  figures  for  indirect  tax collections for FY 2020-21 show that net revenue collections are ₹ 10.71 lakh crore, 108.2 per cent of the Revised Estimates (RE) and have registered a growth of 12.3 per cent YoY. GST collections of Centre during FY 2020-21 stand at ₹ 5.48 lakh crore as compared to ₹ 5.99 lakh crore in FY 201920 - 106 per cent of RE though 8 per cent lower than the last year's collection. In the second half of FY 2020-21, GST collections registered a good growth and collections exceeded ₹ 1 lakh crore in each of the last six months owing to economic recovery during this period. The provisional figures of net direct tax collections for FY 2020-21 are at Rs. 9.45 lakh crore - 104.5 per cent of the RE.

48. The expenditure profile for FY 2020-21 is characterized by an increased thrust on capital expenditure.  Under  the  Scheme  for  'Special  Assistance  to  States  for  Capital  Expenditure', ₹ 11,830.29 crore was released to the States against the earmarked amount of ₹ 12,000 crore in FY 2020-21.  This helped to sustain state level capital expenditure in the pandemic year. In view of the positive  response  to  the  scheme  and  considering  the  requests  of  the  State  Governments,  the Government has decided to continue the scheme in the year 2021-22. An additional amount of upto ₹ 15,000 crore will be provided to States by Government of India as interest free 50-year loan for spending  on  capital  projects  in  FY  2021-22. As  a  part  of  this  Scheme, ₹ 5,000  crore  would  be allocated  to  provide  incentives  to  States  for  monetization/recycling  of  infrastructure  assets  and disinvestment of the State Public Sector Enterprises (SPSEs).

- 49. Data for 17 states and union territories (UTs) that have presented their final budgets for 202122 show a budgeted capex expenditure growth of 9.7 per cent in 2021-22 over the revised estimates for 2020-21. This will be pivotal in bringing back the economy on a high growth trajectory, thereby facilitating buoyant revenues and a sustainable fiscal path in the medium term. As per the Indicative Calendar of Market borrowings by State Governments / Union Territories for the Quarter April June 2021, the quantum of total market borrowings by the State Governments/UTs for Q1: FY 202122 is expected to be ₹ 1.78 lakh crore.
- 50. For the year 2021-22, the Centre has planned to borrow 60 per cent of the annual target of net market borrowings of Rs. 12.05 lakh crore, during the first 6 months-April to September 2021. As  on  23 April  2021,  the  Central  Government  has  raised  Rs.  0.49  lakh  crore  as  gross  market borrowings,  which  is  26  per  cent  higher  than  the  corresponding  period  in  FY  2020-21.  State governments raised Rs. 0.08 lakh crore as gross market borrowings, which is 83 per cent lower than the corresponding period in 2020-21. Based on the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Ways and Means Advances (WMA) to State Governments, 2021, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has revised the WMA Scheme of States and Union Territories (UTs). The WMA limit arrived at by the Committee based on total expenditure of States/ UTs, comes out to be ₹ 47,010 crore. As the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic is still prevalent, the existing interim WMA limit of ₹ 51,560 crore for all States/ UTs shall continue for six months i.e., up to September 30, 2021.

## Outlook

- 51. Consumer confidence for the current period has weakened in March 2021 as the current situation index (CSI), as per RBI Surveys, dipped on the back of deteriorating sentiments on general economic situation,  income  and  prices.  Respondents,  however,  expressed  optimism  for  the  year ahead, which was reflected in the future expectations index (FEI); one year ahead sentiments on all major  parameters  except  prices,  however,  remained  in  positive  terrain.  With  higher  essential spending  vis-a-vis  a  year  ago,  most  consumers  reported  higher  overall  expenditure,  which  is expected  to  increase  further  in  the  coming  year  despite  continuing  moderation  in  discretionary spending. RBI's 28 th round of services and infrastructure outlook survey (SIOS) conducted during January-March 2021 indicated some moderation in the overall business situation and turnover in Q4 FY20-21 after a pace of strong recovery in Q3. Nonetheless, respondents exuded optimism regarding the business situation, employment conditions and turnover for Q1 to Q3 of FY 21-22. Infrastructure companies were optimistic about Q4 of FY2020-21 expecting a sharp uptick in the overall business situation.
- 52. The second wave in India is witnessing a much higher caseload with new peaks of daily cases, daily deaths and positivity rates and presents a challenge to ongoing economic recovery. India is emphasizing on a five-fold strategy to curb the tide of new COVID cases -Test, Track, Treat, COVID Appropriate Behaviour, Vaccination.    A  dynamic  and  concerted  policy  response  to  the second  surge  has  been  initiated  with  ramping  up  health  infrastructure,  oxygen  supplies  and deregulating the vaccine availability for all Indians above the age of 18 from May 1, 2021. With the second wave of COVID-19 infections forcing localized or state-wide restrictions, there is a downside risk to growth in the first quarter of FY:2021-22. However, there are reasons to expect a muted economic impact as compared to the first wave. The experience from other countries suggests a lower correlation between falling mobility and growth as economic activity has learnt to operate 'with COVID-19'.
